# Preetam Baruah - Side-Project(s) : Python

Welcome to my GitHub Repository page.

This page contains Source-Code(s) of my Side-Project(s) in Python. All the Source-Code(s) are Open-Source.


##
##
## Project – Side Project (1)
### Programming Language:
- **_Python 3 (v3.8.2)_**
### Package/Library(s):
- **_TensorFlow_**
- **_Keras_**
- **_Matplotlib_**
- **_opencv-python_**
- **_NumPy_**
- **_Tkinter_**
- **_Pillow_**
### Title:
- **_Sagacious Handwritten Digit Identifier (Deep Learning + Artificial Neural Networks)_**
### Summary:
	It is a Deep Learning (Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning) project.
- _Model (model_train_save.py) –_

		In this Python file, the MNIST Dataset, one of the most popular datasets and preferable for this particular project as it contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, has been loaded with the help of Keras library.
		Then the data has been preprocessed and normalized.
		Then the model has been defined, built, trained, evaluated for errors and finally saved as "model.h5".
		
		Keras has been primarily used. TensorFlow runs in the backend. Convolutional Neural Network has been used.
- _GUI (gui_load_predict.py) –_

		In this Python file, first the saved model, "model.h5", has been loaded. Rest of the code is associated with the GUI App that has been built using Tkinter along with OpenCV for image processing.
### Use Case:
	Well, this is just an extremely tiny project just to showcase my knowledge, skill-set and interest in getting a chance to work in the fascinating, beautiful, staggeringly vast and highly productive field of Deep Learning which has unlimited real world applications in various fields, it will revolutionize the way we see and do things currently and ultimately, will help us taking a colossal leap towards evolution!
	We still need to do a lot of work to reduce the count of the dreadful False Positive(s) though!

## Project – Side Project (2)
### Programming Language:
- **_Python 3 (v3.8.2)_**
### Framework:
- **_Django 2 (v2.1)_**
### Title:
- **_My Blog (Full Stack Web Application Development)_**
### Summary:
- Its a test 'Blog' created using **_Django_**
- For database, **_SQLite3_** has been used in _Development_ and **_Postgres_** has been used in _Production_
- **_Heroku_** has been used for web _deployment_ to make this blog publicly available _over the internet_
- **_Git_** has been used for _version-control_
- **_HTML5_** and **_CSS_**, along with **_Bootstrap_** has been used in _frontend_
- **_django-crispy-forms_** library has been used for _advanced form rendering_

**_[Heroku Link](https://mydjtestblog.herokuapp.com/)_** to _'My Blog'_
### Use Case:
	This is a test blog with common functionalities of a typical blog. One can create-edit-view user accounts and info, view-create-edit-delete posts, login-logout to-from their user profiles respectively. Home and About pages included. Passwords can be changed via email as well.

## Project – Side Project (3)
### Programming Language:
- **_Python 3 (v3.7.3)_**
### Title:
- **_Ingenious Attack Tool_**
### Summary:
	It can be used to test WAF(s). It can be used to send different Attack Requests to a WAF. It takes user-input from a JSON File. It is integrated with one of my Python Scripts that selects the desired HTTP Method in an HTTP Request.
	Python Module used – "requests".
- _Integration –_

	**1.** JSON file - User-Input JSON

	**2.** My Python file - 'HTTP Method Selection Tool'

	**3.** Python file - JSON Values assigned to different Objects
### Use Case:
	This tool has been used extensively in testing "Appwall (Radware WAF)" and in the Automation Project in REST API using Python and Robot Framework I worked on. I could send different kinds of Attack Requests in which I can specify the - HTTP Method, Request Type (HTTP/HTTPS), Host Name, CDN Header and IP, Query Parameter-Value(s) in URL, JSON Parameter-Value(s) in Body and URL-Encoded Parameter-Value(s) in Body.

## Project – Side Project (4)
### Programming Language:
- **_Python 3 (v3.7.3)_**
### Title:
- **_Web-Socket Server Tool (Web-Socket Programming)_**
### Summary:
	It imitates a Server and accepts traffic on a configurable Port Number.
### Use Case:
	During a customer case, I used this tool to imitate an SMTP Server on Default TCP Port 25, generated Traffic from DUT and took Packet-Capture for Analyzing whether Traffic goes via Data or Management Interface.

## Project – Side Project (5)
### Programming Language:
- **_Python 3 (v3.7.3)_**
### Title:
- **_Nearest Data Point Tracker Tool_**
### Summary:
	It takes all the data points, positive as well as negative integers, from a user. Then it puts all those data points in a List, takes a value from a user and prints out the Nearest Data Point from the List. Fully functional – tested successfully.
### Use Case:
	This tool has significant applications in analyzing data points from a graph or pie-chart in Data Science.
